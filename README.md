# Geo-Location Based Task Reminder App/Bot

#### In today's busy world, we often have tasks scattered across different locations, making it difficult to remember and complete them on time. Our project aims to solve this issue by creating a geo-location-based reminder app (or Telegram bot) that helps users manage and complete their tasks more efficiently by tagging them to specific locations.

### Problem: Imagine you have 3 tasks to complete in your college and 2 tasks on your way to school. Due to the hectic nature of life, it’s easy to forget some of these tasks. Failing to complete them on time might result in missed deadlines or incomplete errands.

# Solution: With our app or bot, users can:

#### 1 .   Tag locations where tasks need to be completed.

#### 2 .  Receive reminders as they enter the proximity of these locations, reminding them of the pending tasks.

#### 3 .   If tasks are not marked as complete and the user leaves the location, the app/bot will alert them again, ensuring nothing is missed.

#### 4 .   Extended Functionality: The app/bot can also handle flexible tasks. For example, if a user has added a task to deposit cash at a CDM, it will notify the user whenever they are driving near any CDM, making task completion more convenient and spontaneous.


This system ensures tasks are completed based on location and proximity, helping users stay organized and productive throughout the day.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
